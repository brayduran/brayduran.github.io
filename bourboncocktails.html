            <p>The old fasioned is a true timeless cocktail to cause the drinker to remember the days when men like Don Draper had the run of the town.</p>
            <p>Traditionally made by muddling sugar with bitters, then adding the alcohol - traditionally whiskey or bourbon.</p>
            <p>A twist of orange rind, and presentation over a single ice cube in a short tumber finishes off this classic of a cocktail.</p>

            <p>Bourbon is a traditionally southern spirit, but this timeless drink was created in the northern city of New York City.</p>
            <p>3 parts Bourbon and 1 part sweet Vermouth are mixed with a few light dashes of bitters.</p>
            <p>Served either up in a martini glass or over ice in a rocks glass, the final touch is a garnish of a Maraschino Cherry.</p>
          <li>Bourbon Sour</li>

            <p>A favorite of Johnny Depp, thsi simple Bourbon cocktail will pack a punch while delivering a refreshing cleansing of the palette.</p>
            <p>2 parts Bourbon mixed with 1 part Lemon Juice will deliver the traditional sour twist sought after by fans of this drink.</p>
            <p>Traditionally served over ice with a dash of sugar and two Maraschino Cherries counteract the sour taste.</p>
