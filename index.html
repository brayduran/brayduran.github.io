    <h1><strong>Bourbon/Whiskey Cocktails</strong></h1>
      <ul>
          <li>Old Fashioned</li>
          <p><img src="Old Fashioned.jpg"></p>
          <p>The old fasioned is a true timeless cocktail to cause the drinker to remember the days when men like Don Draper had the run of the town.</p>
          <p>Traditionally made by muddling sugar with bitters, then adding the alcohol - traditionally whiskey or bourbon.</p>
          <p>A twist of orange rind, and presentation over a single ice cube in a short tumber finishes off this classic of a cocktail.</p>
          <li>Manhattan</li>

          <p>Bourbon is a traditionally southern spirit, but this timeless drink was created in the northern city of New York City.</p>
          <p>3 parts Bourbon and 1 part sweet Vermouth are mixed with a few light dashes of bitters.</p>
          <p>Served either up in a martini glass or over ice in a rocks glass, the final touch is a garnish of a Maraschino Cherry.</p>
          <li>Bourbon Sour</li>
          <p><img src="Bourbon Sour.jpg"></p>
          <p>A favorite of Johnny Depp, thsi simple Bourbon cocktail will pack a punch while delivering a refreshing cleansing of the palette.</p>
          <p>2 parts Bourbon mixed with 1 part Lemon Juice will deliver the traditional sour twist sought after by fans of this drink.</p>
          <p>Traditionally served over ice with a dash of sugar and two Maraschino Cherries counteract the sour taste.</p>
    <h2><strong>Vodka Cocktails</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Vodka Martini</li>
        <p><img src="Vodka Martini.jpg"></p>
          <p>The ultimate classic drink, favorites of men such as James Bond, and all those who desire to emulate him.</p>
          <p>In the words of Jed Bartlet: Shaken, not stirred, will get you cold water with a dash of (gin) and dry vermouth.</p>
          <p>The reason you stir it with a special spoon is so not to chip the ice. James is ordering a weak martini and being snooty about it.</p>
          <p>Vermouth is a tricky addition to the martini, at least for those uninitiated in how to order a martini correctly.</p>
          <ul>
            <li> "Dry" refers to the addition of only a splash of vermouth to lend a bitter taste to the drink.</li>
            <li> "Extra Dry" will only have a tiny drizzle of vermouth, or none at all.</li>
            <li> "Wet" martinis will have close to equal parts of vodka and vermouth.</li>
            <li> A "Perfect" martini will have equal parts of dry and sweet vermouth mixed with the vodka.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Ultimately the vodka martini is garnished with 3 olives on a toothpick. Blue Cheese stuffed olives are a favorite.</p>
          <p>The addition of olive juice to the traditional martini will create the "dirty" variation.</p> 
        <li>Moscow Mule</li>
